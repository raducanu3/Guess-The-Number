<h1> Guess My Number </h1>

This is a simple number guessing game which generates a number between 1 and 50, then:
- Players input guesses into a field and click the "check" button
- Correct guesses prompt a "Correct Number!" message, change the background color to green, and enlarge the secret number display
- Player's current score is updated and high score is updated if the current score is higher
- Incorrect guesses prompt a message saying if it was too high or too low
- The player's score is decreased by one for incorrect guesses
- If the player's score reaches 0, the game prompts a "You lost the game!" message
- Players can start a new game by clicking the "Again!" button, which resets the game
